## **About this project**

This is the third group assignment (8th assignment) for Fullstack Developer students at Chas Academy.

This project was built using MERN-stack and deployed via Heroku and Netlify.

Before you clone and start this project make sure you have Node.js
installed and have a working local or hosted version of MongoDB.

This project was created to work together with a [React, TypeScript frontend](https://github.com/louisehedman/hello-worlds-fe).  
Instructions for how to set up the frontend part of this project can be found in the frontend repo.

## **Tech Stack**

**Client:** React, TypeScript, Bootstrap  
**Server:** Node, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, Nodemon

## **Project setup**

After cloning this repo navigate to the root folder in your terminal.

#### **Note!**

ESlint will warn about types not found. This does not effect the app running properly in the browser.
Disable the ESlint extension and reload VS Code.

- Clone repo

- From the project root folder run

```bash
$ npm install
```

- In the root folder create file `.env`.
- Add the following variables:

```env

PORT=<Choose your port>     // Express.js server
DB_URI=<Your MongoDB URI>   // MongoDB URI
JWT_SECRET=<Secret string>
JWT_EXPIRE=<JWT token expiration time>

```

- Seed the database with planet data using the command:

```
$ npm run seed
```

This will first drop "planets" and "blogs" collections if they exists and then create them
and insert documents for each planet and placeholder blog posts.

When the seeding is complete `Ctrl+C` in your terminal to close the server connection.  
For development, start the server again using Nodemon to automatically restart
the server on changes to `.ts` files with command:

```
$ npm run dev
```

To simply start the server without Nodemon use

```
$ npm start
```
