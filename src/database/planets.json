    "description": "Mercury promises a sunny holiday, actually it's the planet closest to the sun. It's also the second smallest planet in our solar system (only Pluto is smaller). A year on Mercury, the time it takes to rotate around the sun, is 88 days, it's faster than any other planet. But Mercury rotates around its own axis very slowly, it takes 59 earth days, that is one day on Mercury. The travel time from earth to Mercury with Hello World(s), in earth days, is 146 days. \nThe temperature here differs a lot during night and day, 430°C in the middle of the day and -180°C during night. You therefore need to prepare your clothes for all temperatures, but not all kinds of weather. Since Mercury nearly doesn't have any atmosphere at all there are no winds, rain or clouds, perfect for you who are tired of talking and hearing about the weather! \nThe surface of Mercury is dark gray, rocky and covered with a thick layer of dust, and is because of that a very popular destination for motocross riders. There have been several motocross competitions arranged on Mercury, highly appreciated by both participants and spectators. \nRumors say that there can be water ice in the craters of the poles, that's because the crater floors are permanently shadowed by the crater rims. Polar expedition on Mercury, how fun?!\nThe gravitation on Mercury surface is only 38 % of gravitation on earth. That means if you weigh 50 kg it will feel like you only weigh 19 kg on Mercury. Think of all the donuts you can eat without worries, actually Mercury has really nice award-winning bakeries. \nMercury has no moons\n",

Fun fact is that on the 2nd of August 1989 the wind speed reached up to 965km/h moving east and 2 415km/h moving west! Despite being the 8th planet from the sun, the wind sport experience on this planet isn't anything Earth can compete with, which makes the long trip worthwhile. \nIt takes Neptune 165 years to travel around the sun and in 2176 Neptune will return to the same place where it once was discovered. It was discovered on september 23 in 1846 by the German astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle.",

Pluto contains more than three times as much water than Earth. Small, cozy and with several moons perfect for a day trip, this dwarf planet will be an experience of a lifetime! Pluto's diameter is only 2 380 km which is perfect if you are looking for an intimate time out in space. On average the temperature is around -232°C, so don't forget to bring warm clothing. \n\n*Disclaimer: Hello World(s) know the definition of \"dwarf planet\" is a controversial topic.

Uranus is also one of the coldest planets with the temperature of -205°C, sometimes even down at -225°C. So if you're looking for skiing with a nice inclination, visit Uranus. \nIf you want to choose a modern destination then Uranus is definitely something for you. Because Uranus is one of the first modern planets that humankind discovered. \nUranus wasn't known until a British man discovered it with a telescope, in the year 1781. His name was William Herschel.\nUranus is the seventh planet from the sun and used to be called “The God of Earth”. People assumed that Uranus was a comet or a star, but according to the latest measurements regarding the orbit of Uranus, the astronauts were convinced that Uranus was indeed a planet.\nRelating to the Earth, which has an inclination of more than 23.5 degrees from the vertical plane, Uranus has surprisingly an inclination of 98 degrees, this means that Uranus is rolling around the sun on its own side. If you future travelers really do want to experience a real rollercoaster holiday, then Uranus is your destination, and something you should consider. Imagine a warm soup, or a warm tea at the Alpines of Uranus, with a cozy inclination?\nThe seasons on Uranus are incredibly 21 years long, which means that it takes Uranus 84 years to rotate around the sun.\n",

Maybe, enough hot to convince you travelers to visit Venus for a fantastic week full of sun, parties, and beaches?\nVenus plays an important role for the scientists to be able to understand the greenhouse effect on the Earth, and the role carbon dioxide plays.
